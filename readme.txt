In order for the app to work, it uses Node, so it will need to be installed with the dependencies on the package file,
so after installing node, navigate to the electron folder on the console, cd electron, and use the command npm install 
first so the packages required (curently electron, electron-rebuild and better-sqlite3) are downloaded and after use 
the command npm run start, so the app can run.
